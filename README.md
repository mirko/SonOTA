# SonOTA

## Updating a new Sonoff device

The latest updates include binary files (thanks to the great work by https://github.com/khcnz/Espressif2Arduino) so you can update your Sonoff device
from start to finish without having to build anything. 

The included final Arduino Sketch binary is https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota (v5.5.2, the only change is defaulting to AP mode rather than WPS when unconfigured).

### Running

To run, firstly download the repo (either using `git clone`, or downloading the .zip file). You must run Python 3.5 (later should work, but untested, v3.5 is recommended for Windows as the `netifaces` module has prebuilt wheels), and the python dependencies. To install the dependencies, change into the SonOTA directory and run:
`pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`

Once installed, you can run SonOTA (`./sonota.py`, you may need something like `python3 sonota.py` on Windows), and it will prompt you for the various settings it needs, and guide you through what to do for each step.

### Update Steps

The update will go as follows (assuming a stock Sonoff device, the included .bin files have been tested with a Sonoff Basic and a Sonoff Dual). The program will prompt you what to do for each step as required.

1. You will be promted to fill out the settings for your network (the "server" IP, this is the IP of the PC you are running `sonota` on, and the SSID and password for your WiFi). (These can also be passed as command line arguments if preferred, or doing a lot of devices.)
2. Connect to the `ITEAD-*` WiFi network, you may need to reset your Sonoff to defaults to do this. This stage tells the Sonoff where to get future updates.
3. Typically, you will be disconnected automatically from the `ITEAD-*` WiFi network, and your PC will reconnect to your normal network. So this stage will require no intervention, and the Sonoff will connect to your PC to download the required firmware.
4. Once the firmware has been downloaded, there will be a new `FinalStage` SSID that you can connect to. Do this, and the device will then download the final stages of the firmware, including the Arduino image, replacing the default boot loader.
5. That's it! You should be all done and ready to use your new Arduino Firmware.

### Important Files

The `static/` directory includes 3 binary files, these are:

* **image_user1-0x01000.bin**: The image for the first half of the flash, this may not be required depending on the initial state of the Sonoff. This just downloads the user2 image below.
* **image_user2-0x81000.bin**: The image for the second half of the flash, this is the one that will replace the boot loader, then install *image_arduino.bin*.
* **image_arduino.bin**: The actual Arduino built image, the repo has Sonoff-Tasmota included, but can be overwritten.

The `ssl/` directory has some pregenerated SSL certificates. As the Sonoff does not verify the SSL certificates, these offer no real security, so to make things easy, they have been included in the repo.

### Changing Firmware

If you decide that Sonoff-Tasmota is not for you, it has an easy to use feature to allow uploading of new firmware.

If you connect to the web interface of the device (either normally, or in AP mode), then change the URL path to be `/up`, you can browse to a local binary file on your computer, and upload. Be sure to use something that you have tested as if this goes bad, you'll need to open up your Sonoff and update using the old serial method.

### Flashing Itead Sonoff devices via original OTA mechanism

This program is based on research documented here:

- https://blog.nanl.de/2017/05/sonota-flashing-itead-sonoff-devices-via-original-ota-mechanism/
- https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/issues/476
- https://wiki.almeroth.com/doku.php?id=projects:sonoff

The script is fairly well documented (I think) - apart from that above stated links should provide some context of what's been done how and why. Feel free to open issue tickets or contact me directly: sonota@nanl.de
